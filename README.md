# Intermediate-Machine-Learning-Kaggle
Handle missing values, non-numeric values, data leakage, and more.

### 1) A Simple Option: Drop Columns with Missing Values
> Unless most values in the dropped columns are missing, the model loses access to a lot of (potentially useful!) information with this approach. As an extreme example, consider a dataset with 10,000 rows, where one important column is missing a single entry. This approach would drop the column entirely!

```Python
# Get names of columns with missing values
cols_with_missing = [col for col in X_train.columns
                     if X_train[col].isnull().any()]

# Drop columns in training and validation data
reduced_X_train = X_train.drop(cols_with_missing, axis=1)
reduced_X_valid = X_valid.drop(cols_with_missing, axis=1)

print("MAE from Approach 1 (Drop columns with missing values):")
print(score_dataset(reduced_X_train, reduced_X_valid, y_train, y_valid))
```
Out:
```
MAE from Approach 1 (Drop columns with missing values):
183550.22137772635
```

### 2) A Better Option: Imputation
> Imputation fills in the missing values with some number. For instance, we can fill in the mean value along each column.
>
>  The imputed value won't be exactly right in most cases, but it usually leads to more accurate models than you would get from dropping the column entirely.

```Python
from sklearn.impute import SimpleImputer

# Imputation
my_imputer = SimpleImputer()
imputed_X_train = pd.DataFrame(my_imputer.fit_transform(X_train))
imputed_X_valid = pd.DataFrame(my_imputer.transform(X_valid))

# Imputation removed column names; put them back
imputed_X_train.columns = X_train.columns
imputed_X_valid.columns = X_valid.columns

print("MAE from Approach 2 (Imputation):")
print(score_dataset(imputed_X_train, imputed_X_valid, y_train, y_valid))
```
Out:
```
MAE from Approach 2 (Imputation):
178166.46269899711
```

### 3) An Extension To Imputation
> Imputation is the standard approach, and it usually works well. However, imputed values may be systematically above or below their actual values (which weren't collected in the dataset). Or rows with missing values may be unique in some other way. In that case, your model would make better predictions by considering which values were originally missing.
>
> In this approach, we impute the missing values, as before. And, additionally, for each column with missing entries in the original dataset, we add a new column that shows the location of the imputed entries.
>
> In some cases, this will meaningfully improve results. In other cases, it doesn't help at all.

```Python
# Make copy to avoid changing original data (when imputing)
X_train_plus = X_train.copy()
X_valid_plus = X_valid.copy()

# Make new columns indicating what will be imputed
for col in cols_with_missing:
    X_train_plus[col + '_was_missing'] = X_train_plus[col].isnull()
    X_valid_plus[col + '_was_missing'] = X_valid_plus[col].isnull()

# Imputation
my_imputer = SimpleImputer()
imputed_X_train_plus = pd.DataFrame(my_imputer.fit_transform(X_train_plus))
imputed_X_valid_plus = pd.DataFrame(my_imputer.transform(X_valid_plus))

# Imputation removed column names; put them back
imputed_X_train_plus.columns = X_train_plus.columns
imputed_X_valid_plus.columns = X_valid_plus.columns

print("MAE from Approach 3 (An Extension to Imputation):")
print(score_dataset(imputed_X_train_plus, imputed_X_valid_plus, y_train, y_valid))
```

Out:
```
MAE from Approach 3 (An Extension to Imputation):
178927.503183954
```

#### why did imputation perform better than dropping the columns?Â¶
> The training data has 10864 rows and 12 columns, where three columns contain missing data. For each column, less than half of the entries are missing. Thus, dropping the columns removes a lot of useful information, and so it makes sense that imputation would perform better.
